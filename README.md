Lesson  |                Topic                     |        Description
--------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lesson 1| What Is Feature Engineering              | Understanding the steps, principles, and importance of creating better features for models.
Lesson 2| Mutual Information                       | Using Mutual Information (MI) as a metric to locate and select features that have the most potential relevance to the target variable.
Lesson 3| Creating Features                        | Transforming existing features using **Pandas** and custom functions (e.g., mathematical transformations, groupings) to suit the modeling algorithm.
Lesson 4| Clustering With K-Means                  | Applying **K-Means Clustering** to untangle complex spatial relationships and create new, informative categorical features (cluster labels).
Lesson 5| Principal Component Analysis (PCA)       | A dimensionality reduction technique used to discover new features by analyzing the maximum variation in the data.
Lesson 6| Target Encoding                          | A powerful technique to transform high-cardinality **categorical features** into numerical ones using the statistics of the target variable
